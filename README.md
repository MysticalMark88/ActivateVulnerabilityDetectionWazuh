<h1>Activate Vulnerability Detection in Wazuh.</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project we will activate vulnerability detection in the wazuh manager on on our wazuh server. This will allow us to see any system vulnerabilities on our endpoint servers. We previously set up wazuh and endpoints [here:](https://github.com/MysticalMark88/WazuhSetUp)   
<br />


<h2>Environments Used: </h2>

- <b>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, running on Linode connected over SSH from a local Manjaro system</b>
- <b>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on server endpoints, running on DigitalOcean connected over SSH from the same local system</b>

<h2>Installation & Set Up walk-through:</h2>
