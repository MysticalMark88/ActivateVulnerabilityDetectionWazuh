<h1>Activate Vulnerability Detection in Wazuh.</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project we will activate vulnerability detection in the wazuh manager on on our wazuh server. This will allow us to see any system vulnerabilities on our endpoint servers. We previously set up wazuh and endpoints here: https://github.com/MysticalMark88/WazuhSetUp   
<br />


<h2>Environments Used: </h2>

- <b>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, running on Linode connected over SSH from a local Manjaro system</b>

<h2>Walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
Firstly, we will need to open the wazuh configuration file after logging in to our server hosting the wazuh manager: <br/>

<br />
<br />
We will then scroll to the line in the config file which handles vulnerability detection and change it to enabled:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next, we will enable the operating systems we want to monitor for vulnerabilites. We are using ubuntu so we will make sure to enable it:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now, we will need to restart the wazuh manager service using systemctl for the changes to take effect:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
We can now successfully see all system vulnerabilites for our agents on Wazuh!:  <br/>
